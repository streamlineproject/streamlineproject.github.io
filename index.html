            <h2>The filosofy of this company</h2>
            <p>
                Streaming online is nice. It is fast, user friendly and simple. Yet what if you want to download the content that you where just watching.
                This is where we come in. With an easely installed extension you can download all content that you streamed in you browser.
            </p>
            <h2>Legal warning</h2>
            <p>
                Altho downloading the content that you have legal acces to is not illegal, some content providers might stop you from doing so.
                There is however one catch. It is most defenetly illegal to spread the content downloaded with this extension. Because this means
                you have no control over who watches the content anymore after you spread it on the internet. We strongly advise you keep all your
                downloaded content local.
            </p>
            <h2 class="quote">"The game package manager you need"</h2>
            <h2>General introduction to the pipe</h2>
            <p>
                The Pipe Line Project is a terminal based package manager dedicated to download games from online repositories. This ofcourse is illegal,
                so make sure you use a vpn if you intend to use this packagemanager. 
                None of teh games featured in the packagemanager are located on the Streamline servers. We verify every download
                and test them to make sure they do not contain any virusses and they work. Enjoy the Pipline.
            </p>
